You are the sun and moon and stars, are you
And I could never run away from you

You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?

It's like the world is going to end so soon
And why should I believe myself?

Myself

You, me and everything caught in the fire
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire

You, me and everything caught in the fire
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong
He wants us to listen, he wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget
And he's just like his daddy because he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

And the wise man say I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man say I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
Because I can't find the words and I can't find the songs

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is

It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway

Been thinking about you, your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no-one, and you're now a star
What do you care?

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed?
But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care
When the other men are far, far better

All the things you got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes who bribed the company
To come and see you, honey?

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know, and why should you care
When I'm not there

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed?
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care
When I'm not there

All the things you got, you'll never need
All the things you've got, I bled and I'd bleed to please you

Been thinking about you

Destiny, destiny protect me from the world
Destiny, hold my hand protect me from the world
Here we are with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

And if the world does turn
And if London burns I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be a nothing anymore

Grow my hair, grow my hair
I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be wanna be wanna be Jim Morrison

Here we are with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere
And if the world does turn
And if London burns I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be a nothing anymore


Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed
You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
But you don't understand
You've no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

Aeroplane
Do I mean what I mean?
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane
A thousand miles an hour
And politics in power
That you don't understand
You've no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere
With no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

I never wanted anything but this
I worked hard, tried hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died hard

Every time you're running out of here
Every time you're running I get the fear

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

Every time you're running out on me
Every time you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

The waters spray, the waters run all over me
The waters spray, the waters run
And this time you're gonna pay

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

I can't afford to breathe in this time
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray

I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I wanna breathe, I wanna grow
I'd say I want it but I don't know how
I work, I bleed, I beg and pray

But I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

Why?

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down

Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

So many things that keep, that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find
If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before

And even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before
And even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't
Even though I might, even though I try, I can't

I feel better
I feel better now you've gone
I got better
I got better, I got strong

And I feel better
I feel better now there's nothing wrong
I got better
I got better, I got strong

Tell me something
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me one thing
Tell me one thing and let it go

I've got something
I've got something heaven knows
I got something
I got something I don't know

In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

And everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone

I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out

And everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone

Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
Then it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done

This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

But it was just a laugh, just a laugh
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten ton head, made of wet sand
Oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
In split infinity

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into your darkest hour

When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
Sweet times
Sweet darling
Sweet times

Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light, born of a light
The wind rushing 'round my open heart
An open ravine with my spirit wide
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light, one I didnâ€™t know
Totally alive, totally released

Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah, you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of
Yeah, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible

You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up the tinderbox
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop

Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
When you take me back
Take me back again
Will you take me back
Take me back again

Hey, it's me, I just got off the train
A frightening place, the faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket? The panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama, message coming in
In the oh-so-smug glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day

Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care

I feel this love to the core
I feel this love turn cold

A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me

The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all

But now I see you messing me around
I donâ€™t want to know, I donâ€™t want to know, I donâ€™t want
When I see you messing me around
I donâ€™t want to know, I donâ€™t want to know, I donâ€™t want to know

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain

It holds us like a phantom
It touches like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
Cause we're not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else

(One day at a time)
One day at a time

We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers don't decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours

One day at a time

This dance, this dance
Is like a weapon, is like a weapon
Of self-defence, of self-defence
Against the present, against the present
The present tense
No, I won't get heavy, don't get heavy
Keep it light and keep it moving
I am doing no harm
As my world comes crashing down
I'll be dancing, freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind

In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost

I won't turn around or the penny drops
Won't stop now, won't slack off
Or all this love will be in vain
To stop from falling down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
Where all this love has been in vain

In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost
In you, I'm lost

All the holes at once
Are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey

The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

All the birds stay up
In the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here
Come to me
Before it's too late
[Chorus]
The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

Iâ€™ll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
Iâ€™ll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

Just donâ€™t leave
Donâ€™t leave

Iâ€™m not living
Iâ€™m just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

Just donâ€™t leave
Donâ€™t leave

And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps

Just donâ€™t leave
Donâ€™t leave

I'm lost, I'm a ghost
Dispossessed, taken host
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul

These rumors and suspicion
Anger is a poison
The only truth that I could see
Is when you put your lips to me
Futures tricked by the past
Spectre, how he laughs

Fear puts a spell on us
Always second-guessing love
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
The only truth that I can see
Spectre has come for me

Keep your distance
Then no harm will come

No ill wind
Will blow
Will blow

Sudden words
Must never be spoken

All ill wind
Will blow
Will blow

Keep your cool
Do not give into emotion

An ill wind
Will blow
Will blow
